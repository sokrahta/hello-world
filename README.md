Hello Git Hubs! 

So, hobbies and what not... 
Card - from hold'em to duplicate bridge. 
Bicycles - I like to ride to work, and when that was 13 miles away it was a great semi-scenic journey twice a day. Now I'll detour up to Greenlake or Mercer Island on the way. 
Motorcycles - I like to race, at the track of course. Personal land speed record 302 kph (188 mph imperial). 
Shiny side up!
